"""
You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0

Note:
S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.
