/**-------------------------Title---------------------------------
 Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n,
 find the one that is missing from the array.

 For example,
 Given nums = [0, 1, 3] return 2.

 Note:
 Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity.
 Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?
